1
00:00:47,846 --> 00:00:49,890
<i>Glendale, California.</i>

2
00:01:12,788 --> 00:01:13,622
<i>Whatever</i>

3
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:19,502
<i>I went down to the beach and saw Kiki</i>

4
00:01:19,586 --> 00:01:22,005
<i>She was all like, "Ehh"
And I'm like, whatever</i>

5
00:01:25,509 --> 00:01:27,593
<i>Then this chick comes up to me
And she's all like</i>

6
00:01:27,677 --> 00:01:29,679
<i>"Hey, aren't you that dude?"
And I'm like, yeah, whatever</i>

7
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:36,185
<i>So later, I'm at the pool hall
And this girl comes up</i>

8
00:01:36,269 --> 00:01:38,605
<i>And she's all like, "Aww"
And I'm like, yeah, whatever</i>

9
00:01:40,816 --> 00:01:44,277
<i>'Cause this is my
United States of Whatever</i>

10
00:01:46,571 --> 00:01:50,158
<i>And this is my United States of Whatever</i>

11
00:01:52,911 --> 00:01:56,248
<i>And this is my United States of Whatever</i>

12
00:01:58,083 --> 00:01:59,251
Lucas!

13
00:02:00,085 --> 00:02:02,754
<i>And then it's 3 a.m.
I'm on the corner wearing my leather</i>

14
00:02:02,838 --> 00:02:05,674
<i>And this dude comes up and he's like
"Hey, punk!" I'm like, yeah, whatever</i>

15
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:08,843
Lucas.

16
00:02:08,927 --> 00:02:11,721
<i>Then I'm throwing dice in the alley
Officer Leroy comes up</i>

17
00:02:11,805 --> 00:02:14,516
<i>He's like, "Hey, I thought I told you"
And I'm like, yeah, whatever</i>

18
00:02:17,352 --> 00:02:19,937
One, two...

19
00:02:20,021 --> 00:02:22,190
<i>Then up comes Zafo
I'm like, "Yo, Zafo. What's up?"</i>

20
00:02:22,274 --> 00:02:23,775
<i>He's like, "Nothin'"
And I'm like, "That's cool"</i>

21
00:02:24,985 --> 00:02:28,238
<i>'Cause this is my
United States of Whatever</i>

22
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:33,994
<i>And this is my United States of Whatever</i>

23
00:02:50,343 --> 00:02:51,970
That's my agent, fellas.

24
00:02:53,722 --> 00:02:55,681
So what'd I do right this time?

25
00:02:55,765 --> 00:02:58,226
I've got bad news and bad news.

26
00:02:58,852 --> 00:03:00,228
Let's start with the bad.

27
00:03:00,312 --> 00:03:01,188
Very well.

28
00:03:01,688 --> 00:03:03,856
Lucas, between your string
of box-office bombs

29
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:06,859
and reports
of your toxic skater boi behavior,

30
00:03:06,943 --> 00:03:10,571
this town's on the verge of saying,
"See you later, boi."

31
00:03:10,655 --> 00:03:13,658
You are one mistake away from movie jail!

32
00:03:13,742 --> 00:03:16,161
Good thing I've got
a get-out-of-jail-free card...

33
00:03:16,995 --> 00:03:18,079
this smile!

34
00:03:19,581 --> 00:03:23,167
You realize I can't see you, right?
We're on the phone, yeah?

35
00:03:23,251 --> 00:03:25,878
Lucas, you need to get your act together.

36
00:03:25,962 --> 00:03:28,089
My act is acting.

37
00:03:28,173 --> 00:03:31,175
You want goody-two-shoes,
buy 'em at a shoe store.

38
00:03:31,259 --> 00:03:35,263
Well, that's just the sort of thing that's
made you nigh unemployable, isn't it?

39
00:03:35,347 --> 00:03:39,559
We've got one offer for a lead role.
I suggest you take it!

40
00:03:39,643 --> 00:03:42,520
It's probably going to be
the last one for a while!

41
00:03:42,604 --> 00:03:45,314
Your flight to Toronto
departs in four hours.

42
00:03:45,398 --> 00:03:50,695
And remember, you must be professional
at every opportunity,

43
00:03:50,779 --> 00:03:55,575
or the stardom you love so much
will slip through your grasp.

44
00:03:57,786 --> 00:04:04,751
<i>The stardom you love so much
will slip through your grasp.</i>

45
00:04:08,296 --> 00:04:09,381
Whatever.

46
00:04:10,173 --> 00:04:13,677
<i>'Cause this is my
United States of Whatever</i>

47
00:04:15,762 --> 00:04:19,224
<i>And this is my United States of Whatever</i>

48
00:06:31,189 --> 00:06:32,857
While we appreciate your passion,

49
00:06:32,941 --> 00:06:37,153
no one visits the set of a Lucas Lee movie
without explicit permission.

50
00:06:38,321 --> 00:06:39,905
Lucas Lee is here?

51
00:06:39,989 --> 00:06:42,825
Of course he's here.
What do you think our job is?

52
00:06:42,909 --> 00:06:45,912
Oh man!
Do you think we could have a selfie?

53
00:07:09,853 --> 00:07:11,103
Young Neil?

54
00:07:11,187 --> 00:07:13,647
Ramona! Love the new hair.

55
00:07:13,731 --> 00:07:16,609
Have a seat.
They're about to roll the camera.

56
00:07:16,693 --> 00:07:19,487
Not like a bowling ball.
The camera doesn't roll at all.

57
00:07:19,571 --> 00:07:21,239
You learn a lot on a movie set.

58
00:07:29,038 --> 00:07:32,041
Why does the set look
exactly like The Rockit?

59
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:35,211
The director thinks sets
are more authentic than locations.

60
00:07:35,295 --> 00:07:38,756
They don't consult me on those decisions.
I'm just the writer.

61
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,175
Of this movie?

62
00:07:41,092 --> 00:07:42,302
You wrote a movie?

63
00:07:42,802 --> 00:07:43,636
Yes.

64
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:46,097
You wrote a Lucas Lee movie.

65
00:07:46,181 --> 00:07:47,724
Bring in first team!

66
00:07:50,894 --> 00:07:51,895
Let's go.

67
00:08:02,155 --> 00:08:03,698
Hey, Young Neil.

68
00:08:04,532 --> 00:08:06,534
Why is Envy Adams dressed like me?

69
00:08:06,618 --> 00:08:08,161
She's playing Ramona Flowers.

70
00:08:09,037 --> 00:08:09,871
Okay.

71
00:08:10,371 --> 00:08:13,416
Young Neil, what's the title
of this movie?

72
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,626
Quiet on the set!

73
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:18,254
<i>Scott Pilgrim's Precious Little Life.</i>

74
00:08:18,338 --> 00:08:19,547
Scene 12, take 1.

75
00:08:21,508 --> 00:08:22,342
Action!

76
00:08:22,926 --> 00:08:26,053
So are you a fan of Sex Bob-omb?

77
00:08:26,137 --> 00:08:29,432
No, I'm kind of seeing
someone in the band.

78
00:08:29,516 --> 00:08:32,143
That's crazy! I am too!

79
00:08:33,269 --> 00:08:37,565
So, I just want to make sure
I understand what's happening here.

80
00:08:38,066 --> 00:08:41,610
We're both dating Scott
at the same time and don't know it?

81
00:08:41,694 --> 00:08:44,614
Cut! Yes, our lead character is flawed.

82
00:08:45,365 --> 00:08:49,076
You wrote an entire script
about a world where Scott Pilgrim

83
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,078
won the fight with Matthew Patel?

84
00:08:51,162 --> 00:08:52,246
Basically.

85
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:54,123
Do you know where I can find Lucas Lee?

86
00:08:56,626 --> 00:08:57,710
Wait.

87
00:08:57,794 --> 00:08:59,629
Who is he playing in this?

88
00:09:09,222 --> 00:09:12,725
Did you know in the U.S.
these are called Mario Karts?

89
00:09:12,809 --> 00:09:13,935
That can't be true.

90
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:15,978
How would you know that?

91
00:09:16,062 --> 00:09:17,814
I'm from the U.S.

92
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:20,608
Well, they're definitely
called that in Japan.

93
00:09:20,692 --> 00:09:22,443
Pretty sure that's not true either.

94
00:09:23,278 --> 00:09:24,529
Agree to disagree.

95
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:28,658
There's Lucas Lee's trailer.

96
00:09:30,952 --> 00:09:33,120
Thanks for the tour.

97
00:09:33,204 --> 00:09:34,038
Anytime.

98
00:09:34,122 --> 00:09:36,082
I know my way around the studio.

99
00:09:40,044 --> 00:09:41,671
I don't know where I am!

100
00:09:46,509 --> 00:09:47,427
Someone's outside.

101
00:09:48,803 --> 00:09:50,805
Who is it? I'm working on my lines.

102
00:09:51,306 --> 00:09:52,432
It's Ramona.

103
00:09:52,974 --> 00:09:53,933
Flowers.

104
00:10:02,025 --> 00:10:03,192
Oh my god!

105
00:10:04,027 --> 00:10:06,195
Ramona Flowers.

106
00:10:06,279 --> 00:10:07,571
Been a while.

107
00:10:07,655 --> 00:10:09,282
Freshman year, high school.

108
00:10:10,366 --> 00:10:11,575
We need to talk.

109
00:10:11,659 --> 00:10:12,952
I'm not sure we do.

110
00:10:13,703 --> 00:10:15,204
About Scott Pilgrim.

111
00:10:15,288 --> 00:10:16,497
I'm Scott Pilgrim.

112
00:10:16,581 --> 00:10:18,750
No, the real Scott Pilgrim.

113
00:10:19,334 --> 00:10:21,126
You saying I'm a fake Scott Pilgrim?

114
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:24,130
No, the Scott Pilgrim
your character is based on.

115
00:10:25,298 --> 00:10:26,757
I didn't know this was a biopic.

116
00:10:26,841 --> 00:10:28,842
No, it's more like...

117
00:10:28,926 --> 00:10:31,763
Wait, do you even know
what this movie is about?

118
00:10:32,347 --> 00:10:33,514
Have you read the script?

119
00:10:33,598 --> 00:10:34,640
I read the title.

120
00:10:34,724 --> 00:10:36,893
Maybe you should read a little more.

121
00:10:37,393 --> 00:10:40,938
Well, as not fun as it's been to catch up,
I'm needed on set.

122
00:10:41,439 --> 00:10:44,817
We're about to shoot my first scene.
Gotta give the people what they want.

123
00:10:44,901 --> 00:10:47,027
Crank that Lucas Lee charm to 11.

124
00:10:47,111 --> 00:10:49,280
- I think you're a 12.
- Let's make out.

125
00:10:50,448 --> 00:10:53,409
Damn girl! What are you doing later?

126
00:10:55,745 --> 00:10:57,080
Are you hitting on me?

127
00:10:57,830 --> 00:11:00,917
Maybe I am, and maybe I am.

128
00:11:03,419 --> 00:11:04,712
Gross.

129
00:11:08,174 --> 00:11:09,092
My Lord!

130
00:11:22,605 --> 00:11:24,064
Ramona Flowers.

131
00:11:24,148 --> 00:11:25,816
Didn't expect to see you here.

132
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,068
Seeking fame?

133
00:11:27,652 --> 00:11:28,736
Not my style.

134
00:11:30,071 --> 00:11:33,657
Still on the search for my old roommate,
what's-his-name.

135
00:11:33,741 --> 00:11:34,908
Any progress?

136
00:11:34,992 --> 00:11:35,868
Minimal.

137
00:11:35,952 --> 00:11:38,788
But hopefully that's about to change.
What brings you here?

138
00:11:39,372 --> 00:11:42,291
I heard they hired
a notorious heterosexual to play me.

139
00:11:43,084 --> 00:11:44,960
Needed to see this debacle up close.

140
00:11:45,044 --> 00:11:45,878
Action!

141
00:11:48,339 --> 00:11:50,466
I had a dream about that girl again.

142
00:11:51,801 --> 00:11:53,928
I didn't care the first time you told me.

143
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:55,930
I care even less now.

144
00:11:58,975 --> 00:12:00,893
Cut! Let's go again.

145
00:12:02,729 --> 00:12:05,773
Hey, how was that? Gay enough? Any notes?

146
00:12:05,857 --> 00:12:09,902
Yeah. How about you build
a time machine, go back in time,

147
00:12:09,986 --> 00:12:12,363
and never audition for this part
in the first place.

148
00:12:13,156 --> 00:12:14,406
Am I being heckled?

149
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:18,702
Who has the nerve to share
his opinions on the set of my film?

150
00:12:18,786 --> 00:12:20,454
Me. I have the nerve.

151
00:12:20,538 --> 00:12:22,457
You? What's your name?

152
00:12:23,791 --> 00:12:24,876
I'm Wallace Wells.

153
00:12:27,044 --> 00:12:30,798
Method, wow! Bold, confident, impressive.

154
00:12:31,299 --> 00:12:32,592
I love it!

155
00:12:36,637 --> 00:12:38,264
What's happening right now?

156
00:12:39,432 --> 00:12:40,474
Have you acted before?

157
00:12:40,558 --> 00:12:43,478
I considered it.
But I was worried I'd be too good at it.

158
00:12:44,061 --> 00:12:46,021
Wonderful! The part's yours.

159
00:12:46,105 --> 00:12:47,106
What about the other guy?

160
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:49,275
He's already been escorted off set.

161
00:12:51,235 --> 00:12:52,069
What?

162
00:12:53,404 --> 00:12:54,697
Everybody, take five

163
00:12:54,781 --> 00:12:57,157
while we get our new Wallace
to hair and makeup.

164
00:12:57,241 --> 00:13:00,703
You heard him, everybody!
Take five, people.

165
00:13:02,705 --> 00:13:04,373
Hey, Young Neil.

166
00:13:05,124 --> 00:13:08,085
How'd you know exactly what Scott and I
said in bed that morning?

167
00:13:09,754 --> 00:13:12,131
The creative process is a mystery.

168
00:13:12,215 --> 00:13:14,383
Congrats on skipping
all the traditional steps

169
00:13:14,467 --> 00:13:16,260
to becoming a major movie star.

170
00:13:16,344 --> 00:13:18,387
Hey, if Lucas Lee can do it, why not?

171
00:13:18,471 --> 00:13:19,763
Speaking of which,

172
00:13:19,847 --> 00:13:22,391
I hear Mr. Lee is already
balls deep in a sweaty affair

173
00:13:22,475 --> 00:13:24,143
with someone on the production.

174
00:13:24,227 --> 00:13:26,645
You catch any gossip
on who the lucky lady might be?

175
00:13:26,729 --> 00:13:30,816
Not the mystery I'm trying to solve.
And on that note, wish me luck.

176
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:33,778
Hey, you could always wish upon a star.

177
00:13:35,238 --> 00:13:36,781
The star being me.

178
00:13:42,954 --> 00:13:44,038
It's Ramona.

179
00:13:45,706 --> 00:13:48,125
I'm reading the script.
I'm busy. Come back later.

180
00:13:48,209 --> 00:13:51,253
I'm not falling for that.
I know you have a girl in there.

181
00:13:51,337 --> 00:13:53,172
Can we just get this over with?

182
00:13:54,799 --> 00:13:56,384
Fine. It's open.

183
00:14:02,932 --> 00:14:03,850
No girl.

184
00:14:05,351 --> 00:14:06,853
Did you know I'm in this?

185
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:09,355
Yeah. You're the lead.

186
00:14:09,981 --> 00:14:11,982
No, there's a Lucas Lee character,

187
00:14:12,066 --> 00:14:14,234
and Scott tricks him
into grinding to death.

188
00:14:14,318 --> 00:14:17,697
I'd never fall for that.
What kind of idiot would write this?

189
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:27,957
Who put that garbage can there?

190
00:14:30,501 --> 00:14:33,921
Wow, that's a fast garbage can!

191
00:14:34,755 --> 00:14:36,340
So this movie is what would've happened

192
00:14:36,424 --> 00:14:38,967
if Scott won the fight
against Matthew Patel?

193
00:14:39,051 --> 00:14:39,968
Yeah.

194
00:14:40,052 --> 00:14:41,595
Scott defeats all your exes,

195
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:43,806
and the two of you
live happily ever after.

196
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:47,310
Young Neil may not be the brightest,
but he has a vivid imagination.

197
00:14:47,935 --> 00:14:49,269
The ending is unrealistic.

198
00:14:49,353 --> 00:14:51,980
The Ramona Flowers I know
would be on to the next one.

199
00:14:52,064 --> 00:14:53,982
That was a long time ago.

200
00:14:54,066 --> 00:14:55,610
Feels like yesterday.

201
00:14:58,404 --> 00:14:59,613
Why are you here?

202
00:14:59,697 --> 00:15:01,240
Scott's not dead.

203
00:15:01,324 --> 00:15:04,535
Someone wants us to think he is.

204
00:15:04,619 --> 00:15:05,619
Who?

205
00:15:05,703 --> 00:15:06,537
Why?

206
00:15:07,038 --> 00:15:09,122
That's what I'm trying to find out.

207
00:15:09,206 --> 00:15:13,127
Is there anyone from my past
who would do something this messed up?

208
00:15:13,711 --> 00:15:17,214
You think I'd kidnap some Canadian loser
and fake his death?

209
00:15:17,798 --> 00:15:21,051
You willfully chose to join
a league of evil exes.

210
00:15:21,135 --> 00:15:23,179
I need to know how evil you really are.

211
00:15:24,096 --> 00:15:26,390
We're not really evil. It's just branding.

212
00:15:26,474 --> 00:15:27,975
I know your reputation.

213
00:15:30,478 --> 00:15:33,230
You're a quintessential Hollywood bad boy.

214
00:15:33,314 --> 00:15:34,857
You can't judge me.

215
00:15:34,941 --> 00:15:37,484
You're on a quest to find a guy
who was dating a high schooler.

216
00:15:37,568 --> 00:15:39,236
I'd never do anything that stupid.

217
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,364
If I did, my career would be over.

218
00:15:42,448 --> 00:15:43,282
Lucas.

219
00:15:46,243 --> 00:15:47,370
My God!

220
00:15:48,454 --> 00:15:49,371
<i>This just in.</i>

221
00:15:49,455 --> 00:15:54,377
<i>The actor playing Scott Pilgrim is dating
an actress playing a high schooler.</i>

222
00:15:55,211 --> 00:15:57,212
<i>That's actually hilarious!</i>

223
00:15:57,296 --> 00:15:59,506
You're dating a 17-year-old?

224
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:01,509
She's 31 in real life!

225
00:16:03,928 --> 00:16:05,846
An earthquake in Toronto?

226
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:07,765
No, something worse.

227
00:16:12,103 --> 00:16:13,229
Paparazzi!

228
00:16:28,995 --> 00:16:30,121
Leave her alone!

229
00:16:30,788 --> 00:16:32,289
Go! I'll cover you.

230
00:16:35,084 --> 00:16:36,168
Lucas!

231
00:16:44,969 --> 00:16:48,389
We have you surrounded, actor scum!
Show yourself!

232
00:17:07,533 --> 00:17:08,409
Whatever.

233
00:17:09,618 --> 00:17:11,912
<i>Lucas Lee versus the paparazzi.</i>

234
00:17:11,996 --> 00:17:12,872
<i>Fight!</i>

235
00:19:56,952 --> 00:20:03,000
<i>The stardom you love so much
will slip through your grasp.</i>

236
00:20:11,926 --> 00:20:13,135
Need an assist?

237
00:20:13,719 --> 00:20:15,638
Why would you help me?

238
00:20:16,347 --> 00:20:19,016
What do you mean? I always helped you.

239
00:20:37,743 --> 00:20:38,619
<i>Yeah.</i>

240
00:20:40,496 --> 00:20:42,957
<i>Until you left me
with nothing but a broken heart.</i>

241
00:20:50,631 --> 00:20:51,966
<i>And a broken board.</i>

242
00:20:54,343 --> 00:20:56,928
<i>That was the day I decided
who I was gonna be.</i>

243
00:20:57,012 --> 00:21:01,517
<i>The best skater,
the highest paid actor, the biggest star.</i>

244
00:21:04,228 --> 00:21:06,771
That day made me who I am.

245
00:21:06,855 --> 00:21:11,568
So I guess, in a way,
I have to thank you, Ramona.

246
00:21:12,069 --> 00:21:14,989
That's really nice and all,
but we're out of time.

247
00:21:15,781 --> 00:21:17,783
Are you gonna let me help you or not?

248
00:21:18,284 --> 00:21:20,703
Lucas Lee, we know you're in there!

249
00:21:48,772 --> 00:21:49,648
All clear.

250
00:21:50,482 --> 00:21:52,275
I just got off the phone with my agent.

251
00:21:52,359 --> 00:21:55,446
I'm off the movie.
And she's dumping me as a client.

252
00:21:56,739 --> 00:21:58,281
Well, there goes my career.

253
00:21:58,365 --> 00:22:00,825
It's like I'm a show
that's no longer on the air.

254
00:22:00,909 --> 00:22:01,744
I'm a...

255
00:22:02,703 --> 00:22:04,913
Damn. I wish there was a word for it.

256
00:22:08,292 --> 00:22:10,085
Maybe this will all blow over.

257
00:22:10,711 --> 00:22:13,838
Nah, they're already testing
new actors to play Scott.

258
00:22:13,922 --> 00:22:14,965
By tomorrow morning,

259
00:22:15,049 --> 00:22:18,009
someone else will be cast in the role
of the guy you like more than me.

260
00:22:18,093 --> 00:22:20,054
And I'll be back to being nobody.

261
00:22:21,347 --> 00:22:24,975
That was your cue to say something, like,
"You were never nobody, Lucas."

262
00:22:25,726 --> 00:22:29,772
Well, you were definitely nobody,
but I still made out with you.

263
00:22:31,565 --> 00:22:32,733
Hey, I'll take it.

264
00:22:36,779 --> 00:22:39,448
Still think I kidnapped
the real Scott Pilgrim?

265
00:22:40,032 --> 00:22:40,949
No.

266
00:22:41,033 --> 00:22:42,867
I don't see you as a kidnapping guy.

267
00:22:42,951 --> 00:22:43,952
Or a portal guy.

268
00:22:44,578 --> 00:22:46,579
Good. Because I didn't.

269
00:22:46,663 --> 00:22:49,708
That was the night
of the <i>Teen Sorcerer 4</i> premiere in L.A.

270
00:22:50,292 --> 00:22:52,419
I got blitzed
and puked on Winifred Hailey.

271
00:22:52,503 --> 00:22:54,338
You can find the photos online.

272
00:22:55,005 --> 00:22:57,174
Guess someone else
took your stupid boyfriend.

273
00:22:57,674 --> 00:22:59,176
He's not my boyfriend.

274
00:22:59,802 --> 00:23:02,679
Whoever did this kept that train
from leaving the station.

275
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:05,015
Take care of yourself, Lucas.

276
00:23:07,893 --> 00:23:08,727
Whatever.

277
00:23:33,419 --> 00:23:35,003
Vegan powers.

278
00:23:35,587 --> 00:23:36,839
Vegan portals?

279
00:23:40,926 --> 00:23:42,302
Yes, hello.

280
00:23:42,386 --> 00:23:43,470
I'm Todd Ingram.

281
00:23:44,054 --> 00:23:47,349
I'm vegan, and I'm here to audition
for the part of Scott Pilgrim.

282
00:23:47,433 --> 00:23:49,184
Scott Pilgrim?

283
00:23:49,268 --> 00:23:51,227
You mean the lead role in this picture?

284
00:23:51,311 --> 00:23:53,272
Well, good luck.

285
00:23:54,064 --> 00:23:56,108
Watch out, guys. Vegan coming through.
